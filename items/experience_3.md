## Learning Piano

### What was it that you did?

I was learning piano for about 6 years. This was all for fun and not for competitions or recitals.

### When did you do it? 

I started back in 2014 and stopped attending official classes in 2020.

### What was good about it?

I believe that learning piano helped me in my hand eye coordination.

### What was your favourite memory of it?

Playing songs that I enjoyed were nice as my instructor allowed me to print music sheets I would find online and check if they were suitable for my level.

### What didn't you enjoy about it?

The constant practice I needed to do every week started to get very repetitive and boring.

### Give your experience a letter "grade"

I would give piano a B+
