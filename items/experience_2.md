## Halloween City Seasonal Work

### What was it that you did?

I was a sales associate at a seasonal pop-up shop that sold mainly halloween related items (eg. costumes)

### When did you do it? 

I did this in the 2019 fall season.

### What was good about it?

Just getting used to customer service I felt helped developed my patience and rationality.

### What was your favourite memory of it?

We had to "redesign" the store by changing all of the aisle and reorganizing all merchandise. When doing so we just listened to music while working which was honestly a vibe.

### What didn't you enjoy about it?

There were several customers who acted up and many who stole merchandise.

### Give your experience a letter "grade"

This experience I would give a B+
